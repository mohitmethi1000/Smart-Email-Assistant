Getting Started
### 1. Clone the Repository

### 2. Start the Backend Server

Ensure Java 17+ and Maven are installed. Then:

cd email-response
./mvnw spring-boot:run

The server runs by default on http://localhost:8080.
### 3. Configure Gemini API Access

Add your Gemini API key in application.properties:

gemini.api.key=YOUR_API_KEY

Alternatively, export it as an environment variable:

export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key

### 4. Load the Firefox Extension

    Open Firefox and navigate to about:debugging.

    Click “This Firefox” → “Load Temporary Add-on”.

    Select the manifest.json file inside the Extension/ directory.

🔁 How It Works

    When composing a reply in Gmail, the extension detects the compose window.

    An “AI Reply” button and tone dropdown are injected into the toolbar.

    Upon clicking, the selected tone and email content are sent to:

    POST http://localhost:8080/api/email/generate

    The Spring Boot backend processes the request, calls Gemini API, and returns a generated reply.

    The extension automatically inserts the response into Gmail's reply box.
